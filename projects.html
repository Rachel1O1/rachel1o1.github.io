                        From my current internship at <a href="https://nupt.ai/">Nupt.AI</a>, I've designed and implemented various features ranging from the Guest Q&A Chatbot, to the Guest Message Blast Feature.

                        For ITP368 - Cross-Platform App Development as my final project I made the app, Penny Pocket. Its layout works on both mobile devices and websites.

                    <p>
                        Penny Pocket helps users keep track of expenditures. Users can create, edit, and delete purchase entries that consist of a title, label, cost, recurrence, and date of purchase. These purchases are then visualized on a calendar on another tab. Users may also sort by labels when viewing their entries.

                    <p>
                        For CSCI353 - Introduction to Internetworking a project was writing the code in C++ to simulate up a network of servers on a single computer and send TCP packages back and forth. This included receiving, sending, and forwarding packages accordingly, sending updates on the network for when servers joined or left, as well as keeping logs for each server.

                        For CSCI356 - Computer Systems one of the projects was writing a custom dynamic storage allocator in C.
                        This included programming a personal version of malloc, free, and realloc routines as well as optimizing for space and time efficiency by minimizing internal and external fragmentation, using an explicit free list,
coalescing, and using a modified first placement algorithm.

                        For ITP380 - Video Game Programming as a project, each student made this Asteroids Game.
                        With assets already provided and building off code from earlier ITP380 projects, I programmed this game from the ship, to the asteroids, to the lasers, etc.

                        For an escape room project I made a mini-game using Unity.
                        Through multiple levels in a 2D top-down puzzle game the player recieves a hint.

                    <p>Spring 2023 - Blender C# Unity</p>
                    <p>
                        An animated experience in VR of being in a bullet train passing various dystopian scenery.
                        Using Blender I modeled in low poly the insides of a bullet train car and exported it to Unity.

                        A multiplayer 2D-platform game that was a group project.
                        I contributed by coding various parts of the UI and game logic which uses libGDX.

                    <p>
                        For HackSC 2023, an annual hackathon hosted at USC I joined a group of other attendees and together made this project.
                        We created a website that would come up with recipes from a specified location based off ingredients the user already had.
                        To do this we used OpenAI GPT-3 API and Ruby on Rails for the backend of a website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript front-end.
                        I contributed with the code handling the OpenAI API and its interaction with the Ruby on Rails backend.

                        An animated experience in VR modeled after the Rubber Hand Illusion.
                        I helped with coding to trigger the animation sequence and the animation of the project.

                    <p>
                        As a summer intern at USC Interaction Lab, I helped conduct “M2C: Exploring Design Considerations to Increase Audience Engagement”. 
                        We, a group of 4 interns, added a Reward System (Accessory Shop for Kuri) to MoveToCode (M2C) under guidance of our mentor
                        Thomas Groechel, PhD candidate.
                        I contributed in the creation process by constructing UI, game currency, and store interactions in Unity. 
                        I also transferred models from Blender to Unity and exported the project as an iPhone & iPad app through Xcode.
